# Builders

The `eks-blueprints` framework allows customers to use builders to configure required addons as they prepare a blueprint for setting EKS cluster with required day 2 operational tooling

The framework currently provides support for the following Builders:

| Builder  | Description                                                                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`ObservabilityBuilder`](./observability-builder.md) | Allows you to get started with a builder class to configure required addons as you prepare a blueprint for setting up Observability on an existing EKS cluster or a new EKS cluster.
